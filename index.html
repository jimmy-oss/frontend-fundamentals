    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: <b>HTML,</b> <b>CSS</b> and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
      <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yperText <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. <b>Web</b> browsers understand <b>HTML</b> and render <b> HTML</b> code as websites.</p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs.</a></p>
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>

<!-- the <b> tag was used in the older versions of html files nowdays we use the <strong> tag which in the html5 represents its something important and it stands out while someone tries to load the web browser what i like about the b tag its short and i like using it ðŸ˜ƒ-
The article element represents a section of content that forms an independent part of a document or site; for example, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.
We semantic elements to give elements meaning into it like the div tag
which represents a contained elements thats where class and id attributes come along
The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.-->
